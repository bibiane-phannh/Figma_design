# Pet Spa Management System

My website is designed to facilitate pet spa service bookings for customers. I employ a palette of soothing pastel tones to evoke comfort, relaxation, and familiarity. The customer-facing pages are intricately designed to engage visitors and encourage prolonged interaction. In contrast, the admin and staff interfaces are streamlined for functionality, prioritizing simplicity to efficiently manage operations.
